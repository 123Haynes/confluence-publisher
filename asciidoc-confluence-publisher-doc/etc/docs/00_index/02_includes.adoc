= Includes

AsciiDoc files can include other AsciiDoc files. Included AsciiDoc files do not result in a separate Confluence page, but
instead get included in the corresponding referencing page. This allows for structuring the AsciiDoc files without
impacting the resulting Confluence page tree.

Included AsciiDoc files are resolved relative to the location of the referencing AsciiDoc file and may reside in any
directory within the configured documentation content root.

[NOTE]
====
Include files must be prefixed with an underscore.
