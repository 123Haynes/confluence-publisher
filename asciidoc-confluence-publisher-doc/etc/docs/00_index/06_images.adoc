= Images

Images included in AsciiDoc files are automatically added as an attachment to the corresponding Confluence page and
inserted into the page using the Confluence image tag.

[listing]
....
image::../images/frisbee.png[]
....

image::../images/frisbee.png[]


In addition, width and/or height can be specified explicitly and are respected when inserting the image into the
Confluence page:

[listing]
....
image::../images/frisbee.png[width=100, height=50]
....

image::../images/frisbee.png[width=100, height=50]


[listing]
....
image::../images/frisbee.png[height=75]
....

image::../images/frisbee.png[height=75]
