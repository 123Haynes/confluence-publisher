= Pages

Each AsciiDoc file (unless being an <<02_includes.adoc#, included file>>) will result in a separate Confluence page and
must contain a top-level document title which will be used as the Confluence page title:

[listing]
....
= Document Title
....

According to the restrictions of Confluence, document titles must be unique within the Confluence space the
documentation is published to. The AsciiDoc file name itself is not reflected in Confluence.

== Links between Pages

Links between pages in Confluence are supported using AsciiDoc inter-document cross references. Target pages are
referenced via the path to the corresponding AsciiDoc file. Paths are resolved relative to the location of the
referencing AsciiDoc file.
