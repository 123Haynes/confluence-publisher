= Pages

Each AsciiDoc file (unless being an <<02_includes.adoc#, included file>>) will result in a separate Confluence page and
must contain a top-level document title which will be used as the Confluence page title:

```
= Document Title
```

According to the restrictions of Confluence, document titles must be unique within the Confluence space the
documentation is published to. The AsciiDoc file name itself is not reflected in Confluence.
