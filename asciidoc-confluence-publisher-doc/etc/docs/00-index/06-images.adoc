= Images

Images included in AsciiDoc files are automatically added as an attachment to the corresponding Confluence page and
inserted into the page using the Confluence image tag. Included image files are resolved relative to the location of the
referencing AsciiDoc file.

In addition, width and/or height can be specified explicitly and are respected when inserting the image into the
Confluence page:

[listing]
